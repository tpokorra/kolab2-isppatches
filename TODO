       The web client:

            -> horde
               - Blocks: cloud.php
               - Check the admin section
               - how to handle the secret key setting ($conf[secret_key])
               - Deletion of horde.db?

       The web admin:

            -> Check handling domain maintainers


       Ensure that pear packages may have a complex *.spec file with
       additional instructions in the "install" section.

    - larger effort:

	Handle the php.ini timezone setting correctly. Check if
	it is absolutely necessary to put this choice into kolab_bootstrap.
	Maybe the bootstrap could also determine it automatically.
