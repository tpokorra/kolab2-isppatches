<sect1><title> Virus Checking </title>
<para>By using the <ulink url="http://www.amavis.org/">AMaViS</ulink> interface
it is possible to attach a mail virus scanner. <filename>AMaViS</filename> does
not have the capability of filtering mails - it needs an additionaly installed
virus scanner.
</para>

<para>
Please note that currently no powerful virus scanner exists as free software.

<sect1><title> Spam Filtering </title>
<para>Spam mails are quite common and annoying for users. There are two
main possibilities how to handle this spam mails.
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The MTA - postfix - is capable of handling header and body
checks. Look <ulink url="http://www.hispalinux.es/~data/postfix/">here</ulink>
for a detailed HOWTO with respect to the regular expression filtering
capabilities of the MTA Postfix. It is possible to define multiple rules that
match body or header area of incomming emails.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Additional programmes like <ulink
url="http://spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</ulink> which provide a means of
tagging incomming mails. The tags are created as additional headers in the mail.
Apart from header and body regular expressions SpamAssassin can also use
databases which provide well known spam sources.
Within the client filters can be defined according to the individual preference
of every user on how much spam rating he likes to accept.
</para></listitem>

<sect1><title> Webmail Interface </title>
<para>It is possible to use a webinterface to access emails from a remote
site. This is primarily intended for users who are off site and can not use a
mail user agent. Note that not the full groupware functionality can be provided
at this point in time by using a webmail interface. This can change in the
future.

<sect1><title> LDAP over TLS </title>
<para>The directory service OpenLDAP2 which Kolab uses can handle authentication
and encryption. Accessing LDAP via TLS of course makes sense as the
authentication also transfers password hashes that could be intercepted - and 
be exploited in replay attacks - if
transferred in the clear. The service SASL which authenticates the services
Postfix and Cyrus can access LDAP via TLS. As we have to address also the legacy 
clients we can not restrict direct access to LDAP to TLS.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title> LDAP Migration Tool </title>

<para>Many sites already have site wide user data available in some sort of
directory service. If it is possible to export this user data into so called
University of Michigan LDAP 3.3 / OpenLDAP ldif format it can be imported into 
Kolab's OpenLDAP.
</para>

<para>Especially Microsoft Exchange 5.5 and also Microsoft Exchange 2000 user
data can be exported after authentication into a ldif file which in turn can be
inserted into the Kolab OpenLDAP service.
</para>

<para>All directory services use slightly different schema's. The challenge of
migration hereby is to adapt the exported LDAP data into Kolab's schema. This
can be done by using scripts that are adapted to the originating directory
service.
