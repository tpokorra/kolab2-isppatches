If you patch cyrus-imapd with these patches for Kolab you will
need to ensure in addition that you remove two files from the 
sources:

rm -f lib/imapopts.h lib/imapopts.c

Both will get rebuild automatically during the build process. 
If you don't rebuild them during build time they will be 
outdated.
