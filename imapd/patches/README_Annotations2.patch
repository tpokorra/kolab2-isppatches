DESCRIPTION:

There is an imap extension for adding "annotations" (eg. metadata) to
imap folders in the form of key/value pairs. The key is typically
something like /vendor/<vendorname>/<attributename>. Cyrus imapd only
supports a few special annotation keys for internal use (such as being
able to mark a folder for indexing etc.). The patch extends cyrus imapd
to allow arbitrary annotations on IMAP folders.

IMPACT:

The annotation patch is critical to kolab. Without the patch, the clients
will not know which folder is for calender, tasks etc.

HISTORY

The patch has been submitted upstream and the original version was rejected.

https://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=2458

A new version of the patch has been provided recently by Thomas Viemann 
(http://vman.de/cyrus/).

It looked as though upstream would accept the patch but so far nothing has 
happened. Another status inquiry on 2007-05-21.
