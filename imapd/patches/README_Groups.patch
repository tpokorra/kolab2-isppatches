DESCRIPTION:

Plain cyrus imapd reads groups from /etc/group, and OpenPKG includes
a patch that allows us to use a private file (for example 
/kolab/etc/imapd/groupfile) for this instead of the system one. Groups 
in cyrus can be used in ACLs. To cater for MS windows users who are not 
used to "case matters", the kolab developers patched the openpkg patch 
to use case-insignificant string comparison when looking up groups.

IMPACT:

Groups won't work for the Kolab server if this patch is missing.
