Development notes
=================

The kolab-webadmin package is a PHP based web application. Since no
compilation is necessary it is sufficient to package the "freebusy"
directory for a release.

The Kolab Server packages were usually not released as source
packages. This should be changed with this new package layout. The
"dist" target will produce a kolab-webadmin-*.tar.gz package that can
be distributed as source package. The same run will produce a
kolab-webadmin-*.src.rpm package that is suited for installation on an
OpenPKG system.

Version numbering
=================

kolab-webadmin is a Kolab Server core package. Released packages should
have the same core version as the Server release. As a part of Kolab
Server 2.1.0 the version number should be 2.1.0.

Released source packages will look like this:

 kolab-webadmin-2.1.0.tar.gz

Released source RPMs will look like this:

 kolab-webadmin-2.1.0-20070813.src.rpm

A NEW VERSION AND RELEASE NUMBER HAVE TO BE SET IN

  kolab-webadmin.spec

Once development picks up after a release, please set

%define       V_cvs 1

in kolab-filter.spec.

Source packages will then look like this:

 kolab-webadmin-2.1.0.cvs-20070815.tar.gz

Source RPMs will be named similar:

 kolab-webadmin-2.1.0.cvs-20070815.src.rpm

For tagging the next release the version number needs to be increased
to the new Kolab Server version (e.g. 2.2.0) and the CVS variable needs
to be reset to 0:

%define       V_cvs 0
