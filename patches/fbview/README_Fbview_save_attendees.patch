DESCRIPTION:

This allows to store the list of attendees in the user preferences.
The patch implements this in a hackish way and it was consequently
rejected upstream (http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/?id=4788). This 
should be solved using Horde::Groups or the Turba API.

IMPACT:

You won't be able to store the list of attendees.
