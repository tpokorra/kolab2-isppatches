DESCRIPTION:

The patch for the imap library provided by the university of
Washington adds the capabilities for setting/getting imap
annotations. This is needed for imap caching in the free/busy system
of Kolab-2.1. In addition this patch is required to accelerate Horde.

IMPACT:

The free/busy system won't work without this patch. Horde will run
slower if not using this patch.
