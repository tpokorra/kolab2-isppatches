# Package summary description
summary='PEAR: Generic date/time handling class for PEAR'

# Long package description
description=' \
Generic classes for representation and manipulation of                 \
dates, times and time zones without the need of timestamps,            \
which is a huge limitation for php programs.  Includes time zone data, \
time zone conversions and many date/time conversions.                  \
It does not rely on 32-bit system date stamps, so                      \
you can display calendars and compare dates that date                  \
pre 1970 and post 2038. This package also provides a class             \
to convert date strings between Gregorian and Human calendar formats.  \
