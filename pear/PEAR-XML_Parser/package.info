# Package summary description
summary='XML parsing class based on PHPs bundled expat'

# Long package description
description=' \
This is an XML parser based on PHPs built-in xml extension.  It \
supports two basic modes of operation: func and event. In func \
mode, it will look for a function named after each element, and \
in event mode it uses a set of generic callbacks. \
 \
Since version 1.2.0 theres a new XML_Parser_Simple class that makes \
parsing of most XML documents easier, by automatically providing a \
stack for the elements.  Furthermore its now possible to split the \
parser from the handler object, so you do not have to extend \
XML_Parser anymore in order to parse a document with it. \
