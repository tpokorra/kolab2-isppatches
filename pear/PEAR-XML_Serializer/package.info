# Package summary description
summary='Swiss-army knife for reading and writing XML files. Creates XML files from data structures and vice versa.'

# Long package description
description=' \
XML_Serializer serializes complex data structures like arrays or \
object as XML documents.  This class helps you generating any XML \
document you require without the need for DOM.  Furthermore this \
package can be used as a replacement to serialize() and unserialize() \
as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create \
PHP data structures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if \
type hints are available.  If you use the XML_Unserializer on standard \
XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most \
cases it does exactly what you expect it to do.  Try reading a RSS \
file with XML_Unserializer and you have the whole RSS file in a \
structured array or even a collection of objects, similar to XML_RSS. \
 \
Since version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents similar \
to the simplexml extension of PHP 5. \
