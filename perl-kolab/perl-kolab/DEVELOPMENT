Development notes
=================

The perl-kolab package is a standard perl package and a Kolab Server
core component. It is meant to be handled with the Makefile.PL
script. You will receive a standard "Makefile" by running "perl
Makefile.PL".

The Kolab Server packages were usually not released as source
packages. This should be changed with this new package layout. The
"dist" target will produce a perl-kolab-*.tar.gz package that can be
distributed as source package. The same run will produce a
perl-kolab-*.src.rpm package that is suited for installation on an
OpenPKG system.


Version numbering
=================

The package version will be set in

  lib/Kolab.pm

e.g.

  our $KOLAB_BASE_VERSION = "2.2.beta1";
  my $KOLAB_CVS = 1;

Release versions
----------------

Released packages should have the same core version as the server
release. As a part of Kolab Server 2.2.0 the version number should be
2.2.0. Pre-release candidates receive the suffix "betaX" or "rcX"
(e.g. 2.2.beta1).

Before tagging the next release the version number needs to be increased
to the new Kolab Server version (e.g. 2.2.0) and the CVS switch needs to
be set to 0:

  our $KOLAB_BASE_VERSION = "2.2.0";
  my $KOLAB_CVS = 0;

After updating $KOLAB_BASE_VERSION and $KOLAB_CVS you can commit these
changes and tag the release.

Now you can create source tarballs and RPMs which will look like:

  perl-kolab-2.2.0.tar.gz
  perl-kolab-2.2.0-20070819.src.rpm

Don't forget to change $KOLAB_CVS back to 1 again and commit, so later
CVS snapshots will be named correctly.

Snapshots
---------

Make sure lib/Kolab.pm contains the following line:

  my $KOLAB_CVS = 1;

The release number will then receive the suffix "+cvs" and the current
date will be appended.

Source tarballs and RPMs will then look like this:

  perl-kolab-2.2.0+cvs20070810.tar.gz
  perl-kolab-2.2.0+cvs-20070810.src.rpm
