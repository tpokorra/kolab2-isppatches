DESCRIPTION:

This provides the imap_getannotation and imap_setannotation functions
within PHP. This is needed for imap caching in the free/busy system of
Kolab-2.1. In addition this patch is required to accelerate Horde.

IMPACT:

The free/busy system won't work without this patch. Horde will run
slower if not using this patch.

HISTORY

This patch depends on the imap c-client patch since PHP uses the
c-client library. This can only move forward once the c-client patch
has been integrated.
